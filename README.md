# Minitalk
Minitalk is a project designed to introduce students to **the principles of computer communication**. It involves creating a program that allows one computer to send messages to another using a limited set of instructions and a predefined communication protocol. The project is often used as a teaching tool in computer science courses to help students understand how computers communicate with each other and how to design and implement communication protocols.

# Goal !
The goal of Minitalk is to create a simple program that allows **one computer to send messages to another by sending a sequence of bits over a communication channel**. The receiving computer must be able to interpret the sequence of bits and display the message on the screen. The communication protocol specifies the format of the message, including the number of bits used to represent each character and the order in which the bits are sent.

To complete the Minitalk project, students must design and implement a program that sends and receives messages using the Minitalk communication protocol. The program should be able to send a message from one computer to another and display the message on the screen of the receiving computer. The program should also be able to handle errors, such as incorrect messages or lost bits, and recover from them.
